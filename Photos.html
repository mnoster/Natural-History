                        The <span class="keywords">daphnia</span> , or commonly referred to as "water flea", is found in many freshwater bodies. The transparency of
                        the daphnia's skin allows us to see the functioning organs inside. Often the daphnia carries
                        multiple eggs, which can be seen in this photo in the middle right region of its body.

                        The <span class="keywords">copepod</span> often accompanies the daphnia in the freshwater environment. It is a common source
                        of nutrients among the fish. It falls under the classification of a crustacean and can be found
                        in most bodies of water. Their diet consists mainly of phytoplankton.

                        Usually found in calm fresh bodies of water are <span class="keywords">mosquito larvae</span>. When removed from water they
                        sqirm around chaotically like a fish out of water. They can survive in the worst and best of
                        water conditions, hence their presence all throughout the world

                    <span class="keywords">Hydra</span> are some of the most interesting creatures due to their ability to not age. They have tentacles that retract when anticipating danger.
                    They are found mainly in tropical regions and are also a source of food for fish.

                  Female dragonflies lay their eggs on plants or in water. The eggs hatch into <span class="keywords">larvae</span> and can survive in both the water and land.
                    Once they begin to mature they shed their outer layer of skin, spread their wings and fly away. Fish feed on the dragonfly larvae and are a major food source in some environments.
